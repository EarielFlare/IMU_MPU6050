# PyOpenGL-Tutorial
A Python/PyOpenGL implementation of the first few example programs from Jason McKesson's excellent OpenGL tutorial.

The tutorial book associated with these programs can be found at https://alfonse.bitbucket.io/oldtut/index.html (copyright Jason McKesson). 

The goal of this project is to convert the tutorial's C++ OpenGL examples to Python to demonstrate the ways in which PyOpenGL differs from C++ OpenGL.
